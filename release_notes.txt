2008-11-17 - FreakUSB v0.5

	- Initial release.


2009-11-13 - FreakUSB v0.7 
	- Updated licenses to Modified BSD.
	- Added flow control to prevent buffer overflow. If buffer can't accomodate received data, it will instruct the chip to NAK
	the host until the current buffer data has been processed and new data in FIFO has been safely moved to the buffers.
	- Added smarter buffer sizing. Max buffer size only needs to be set in freakusb.h and all FIFO, buffer, and max packet sizes
	will automatically be set.
	- Added command line support in main demo. For demo, you can now have a command line to send instructions into via a terminal.
	A command table is also provided and you can add your own commands accessible via the command line.
	- Added support for AT90USB162 and ATMega32U4. The AT90USB162 was a bit of a challenge because there is no builtin VBUS detection
	to detect when the device is connected to a host. VBUS must be connected to an interrupt and the interrupt must be mapped to 
	the ISR found in isr.c.
